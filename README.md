# AirbnbKNN

This is the first assignment of a machine learning elective course at RDFZ, Beijing. We intend to predict the house rent price under an Airbnb house renting dataset, using the K Nearest Neighbor algorithm.

This project is currently finished. Please check *AirbnbKNN report.pdf* for our report.
